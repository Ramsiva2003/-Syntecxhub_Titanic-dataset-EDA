# -Syntecxhub_Titanic-dataset-EDA
This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.he analysis identifies key survival patterns among passengers based on gender, class, and age. It also includes data cleaning, visualization, and summary insights.
##  Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset  
- Analyze survival patterns  
- Visualize trends using Seaborn & Matplotlib  
- Summarize insights and export results  

---

##  Tools Used
**Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**

---

## Key Insights
- Females had higher survival rates than males.  
- 1st-class passengers were more likely to survive.  
- Children under 12 had better survival odds.  
- Higher fares correlated with higher survival chances.  

---

## Visualizations
- Survival by Gender  
- Survival by Class  
- Survival by Age Group  
- Age vs Class (Boxplot)  
- Fare vs Class & Survival (Violin Plot)
